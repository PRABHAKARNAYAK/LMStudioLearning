## Alarm E123 (Overvoltage during deceleration)
- Possible causes: braking resistor sizing, DC bus energy not dissipated, line voltage spikes.
- Recommended checks: verify resistor wiring and value, check decel ramps and inertia, inspect supply quality.

## Parameter Pn200
Velocity loop proportional gain (Kvp). Higher values reduce speed error but may cause oscillations.
